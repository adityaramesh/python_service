# Introduction

The `python_service` library makes it easy to write init scripts conforming to
the conventions of various Linux distributions. If the daemon is to be written
in Python, the daemonization process and PID file management are done
automatically. Interprocess communication is used to achieve robust logging and
error reporting for both initialization and termination.
